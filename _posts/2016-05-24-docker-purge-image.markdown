In this post I'll explore some Docker automation for deleting old containers that depend on an image you want to remove.  <!-- more --> Sometimes you have been building an image a few times in different iterations and trying it out. When you want to clean up, you want to remove the image so you run `docker rmi`:

```
vandene@computer:~$ docker rmi mybuiltimage
Error response from daemon: conflict: unable to remove repository reference "mybuiltimage" (must force) - container 8ac1a3a4aa41 is using its referenced image 90d5884b1ee0
vandene@computer:~$ docker rm 8ac1a3a4aa41
8ac1a3a4aa41
vandene@computer:~$ docker rmi mybuiltimage
Error response from daemon: conflict: unable to remove repository reference "mybuiltimage" (must force) - container aa656b16b7bb is using its referenced image 90d5884b1ee0
vandene@computer:~$ docker rm aa656b16b7bb
aa656b16b7bb
vandene@computer:~$ 
```

This is annoying because you have to keep removing the containers one by one, and trying `docker rmi` in between each time to see which one is conflicting next. If you have 10 exited containers from the build process, this becomes tedious. I've written a small bash function to add to your `~/.profile` which introduces a `dockerpurge` command that removes an image and all associated containers in one go:

{% highlight bash %}
function dockerpurge() {
  for cont in `docker ps -a | grep $1 | awk '{print $1}'`; do
    echo removing container $cont
    docker rm $cont
  done 
  echo removing image $1
  docker rmi $1
}
{% endhighlight %}

Now, you can just run the dockerpurge command:

```
vandene@computer:~$ dockerpurge mybuiltimage

Should make life a bit easier.
