Looks like we're back up. Ocean Bioinformatics used to live on [Antagonist](www.antagonist.nl), who are a great host but I moved to the (free!) GitHub pages. This provides a bit more flexibility and most of all ease of use. Edit posts in markdown, push to repo and done. Also, free hosting and it is just a bit more fitting to my current workflow. 

Anyway, thanks for reading. I'll try to archive some old posts on the way for those interested.
